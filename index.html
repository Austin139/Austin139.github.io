      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        I'm <strong>Austin</strong>, a first-year <strong>Computer Science</strong> student at the
        <strong>University of Limerick, Ireland</strong>.<br>
        I’m passionate about technology, programming, and how computer systems can shape the future.
        I love exploring new tools, solving logical problems, and continuously learning through hands-on practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve always been fascinated by how software can automate tasks, analyze data, and make life simpler — this curiosity
        drives me to explore everything from <strong>coding</strong>, to <strong>AI</strong>, and <strong>data science</strong>.
      </p>

        <em>“The best way to learn to code is to build something that excites you.”</em>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Outside academics, I balance my studies with sports and creativity, believing that a healthy mind needs both logic and rhythm.
