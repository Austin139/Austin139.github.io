## Introduction
I'm **Austin**, a first-year **Computer Science** student at the **University of Limerick, Ireland**.  
I’m passionate about technology, programming, and how computer systems can shape the future.  
I love exploring new tools, solving logical problems, and continuously learning through hands-on practice.

I’ve always been fascinated by how software can automate tasks, analyze data, and make life simpler — this curiosity drives me to explore everything from **coding**, to **AI**, and **data science**.

> *“The best way to learn to code is to build something that excites you.”*

Outside academics, I balance my studies with sports and creativity, believing that a healthy mind needs both logic and rhythm.
